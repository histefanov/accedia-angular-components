Set the title attribute to provide the button's text content. Optionally, specify the `size` and `variant` attributes
to adjust the button's appearance. If you would like to customize the component to match your application's color theme,
you can take advantage of the `color` attribute. The provided color will be applied to either the background or the border
of the button, depending on the specified variant. Handle button clicks by listening to the `click` event and calling 
the corresponding function.
