# Bar chart

The <strong>Bar Chart</strong> component enables the visualization of data using horizontal bars of dynamic lengths. 
It offers customization options for component labels, animations, gaps between bars, and legend display.

<Meta of={BarChartStories} />

<Canvas of={BarChartStories.Medium} />

<Controls />

## Functionality

<ul>
  <li>Renders horizontal bars representing different components with their respective values.</li>
  <li>Supports two types of component labels: `amount` for displaying absolute values and `percentage` for displaying values as percentages of the total.</li>
  <li>Provides built-in animations for enhancing user experience when components are added or updated.</li>
  <li>Offers customization options for adjusting the gap between bars, displaying component labels, and showing/hiding the legend.</li>
</ul>

## Usage

Integrate the Bar Chart component into your Angular application by adding the `<acc-bar-chart>` element to your template. 
Bind the `components` input property to an array of objects representing the components to be displayed in the bar chart. 
Each object should contain a <strong>value</strong> property representing the component's value, 
an optional <strong>color</strong> property specifying the bar color, and an optional <strong>description</strong> to be displayed in the legend.
Leaving out the color property of a component will result in a default color being assigned to it. The 16 default colors are public and can be exported. 
<br/><br/>You can customize the behaviour and appearance using input properties such as `componentLabelType` to specify the type of component labels to display, 
`disableAnimations` to disable animations, and `gap` to set the spacing between bars.
