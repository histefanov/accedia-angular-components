# Tabs

The <strong>Tabs</strong> component provides a user-friendly way to implement tabbed navigation
in web applications. It allows users to switch between different content sections
by clicking on the corresponding tab labels.

## Functionality

<ul>
  <li>
    The component consists of a series of tabs, where each tab has a label and
    its associated content.
  </li>
  <li>
    By default, the first tab is active, and its content is displayed when the
    component is loaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Users can click on different tab labels to switch between the corresponding
    tab content.
  </li>
  <li>
    The component supports responsive behavior, adjusting the layout when the
    window is resized.
  </li>
</ul>

## Usage

To use the <strong>Tabs</strong> component, you need to render it inside any template within your application via the `acc-tabs` selector
and define the individual tabs using the <strong>Tab</strong> component (`acc-tab`) as children (see code example).
Each <strong>Tab</strong> component requires a label that will be displayed as the tab's title and its associated content.
Optionally, you can pass a `navSideContent` attribute to each `acc-tab` with a template containing additional content related to that tab.
It can be customized with various elements such as additional text information, buttons, or any other desired content, catering to your specific requirements.
You can customize the `Tabs` component to match your application's color theme by providing a slider color via the `sliderColor` property.

## Additional notes

<ul>
  <li>
    Avoid using the <strong>Tab</strong> component independently outside the
    <strong>Tabs</strong> component context, as the latter handles most of the rendering
    logic and manages the activation and display of individual tabs based on user
    interactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    While you have the ability to control the initially active tab using the
    `isActive` property, it is advisable to refrain from specifying multiple
    active tabs. Doing so may result in undesired behavior when rendering the
    content.
  </li>
</ul>
