# Chart

The <strong>Chart</strong> component is a simple yet interactive and customizable wrapper over the external `d3` library.

<Meta of={ChartStories} />

<Canvas of={ChartStories.Basic} />

<Controls />

## Functionality

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Chart</strong> is used to repreent data structures with the help of
    a pie chart and an accommodating legend
  </li>
  <li>
    Data is provided for the chart items and optionally the legend (text in
    legend for the same item can differ from the one in chart itself)
  </li>
  <li>
    The component allows you to customize the <strong>chart's</strong> colors,
    you are given the ption to set any number of colors, they would follow the
    items in sequence and repeat if the number of items exceeds the numbers of
    colors.
  </li>
  <li>
    The option for text contained within the chart is given along with
    optionally providing a subtext below the main one for further clarification
  </li>
</ul>

## Usage

Use the `acc-chart` selector and pass in your desired configuration through the component's input properties.
Set the `data` attribute to provide the chart's item content. Set the `colors` property to give the chart your
own identity and match your application's color theme. Provide the `text` and `subtext` properties in order to
provide the chart with some more detail and ease of use. Toggle the `hasLegend` property to toggle the legend
on and off.
