# Slider

The <strong>Slider</strong> component provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a value within a range by dragging a thumb along a track.
It offers customization options for label display, thumb size, and value visibility.

## Usage

Integrate the <strong>Slider</strong> component into your Angular application by adding the `<acc-slider>` element to your template.
Customize its behavior and appearance using input properties such as `disabled` to disable the slider, `label` to set the slider label, and `showValue` to control the visibility of the selected value.
Additionally, adjust the thumb size using the `thumbSize` input.<br/><br/>
<strong>valueChange</strong> Event Emitter:<br/>
The component emits a `valueChange` event whenever the user adjusts the slider value.
This event provides the updated value of the slider, allowing you to synchronize it with your application's state or perform any necessary actions based on the new value.
