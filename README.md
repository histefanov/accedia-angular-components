# Introduction

Welcome to the **Accedia's Angular Components Library** documentation! This library provides a collection of reusable, 
customizable, and functional components to streamline the development of your Angular applications. 
Whether you're building forms, navigation, or interactive elements, our components are designed to enhance 
your development experience and improve your application's usability. This library is intended not only for direct use 
in your projects but also as a resource for beginner and intermediate developers who want to learn how to create their own custom components.

## Getting Started

You can load the storybook project by cloning the repository and running `npm run storybook` right after you've installed all of the required npm packages.
